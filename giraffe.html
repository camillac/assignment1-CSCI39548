      Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. They have a uniquely spotted coats and
      their legs alone are taller than most humansâ€”about 6 feet. These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short
      distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances. Their height is also beneficial for reaching leaves
      and buds in treetops that few animals can reach. It is also helpful for keeping a lookout for predators across the wide expanse
      of the African savanna.
