      Red pandas live in the rainy mountain forests of Nepal, India, Bhutan, northern Myanmar, and central China.
      They spend the vast majority of their lives in trees, where they sleep and sunbathe. These animals have
      adapted incredibly well to their environment! They have sharp, semi-retractable claws that help them grip
      slippery branches, and their flexible ankles give them the unique ability to climb down trees headfirst.
      This helps them quickly escape predators like snow leopards and jackals, which may have difficulty seeing
      the animals to begin with. Their coats match the moss clumps that grow on their tree homes, and their black
      bellies make it difficult for predators to spot them from the ground. They like to eat bamboo and can eat up
      to 4 pounds of bamboo a day!
