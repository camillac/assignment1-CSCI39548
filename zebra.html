      These black and white creatures are zebras! Zebras are single-hoofed animals that are native to Africa.
      They are very closely related to horses and donkeys. The most prominent feature of zebras is the bold patterns on their coats.
      Zebras have white stripes next to black or brown stripes, with the stripes ending at their bellies and the inner side of the legs.
      However, their skin is actually black under their coats! This interesting pattern allows them confuse predators with their zig-zag
      movements, especially when they are in herds.
