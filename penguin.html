      This flightless black and white bird is a penguin! Penguins are flightless seabirds that live typically live below the equator in colder climates.
      Some island-dwellers can be found in warmer climates, but most penguins live in and around the icy continent of Antarctica.
      Penguins have a thick layer of blubber and tightly-packed, oily feathers that are ideal for colder temperatures.
      There are 18 different species of penguins that widely vary in shape and size. However, they all have black bodies and white bellies.
      Though flightless, their stiff flippers, webbed feet, and sleek shape make them excellent swimmers, swimmming up to 15 miles an hour!
